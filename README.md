## Project Overview

The application implements a relational database for an e-commerce store with the following entities:

- **Customers**: Stores customer information.
- **Products**: Stores product details.
- **Categories**: Product categories (Many-to-Many with Products).
- **Orders**: Orders made by customers.
- **OrderItems**: Products in each order.
- **Staff**: Staff members managing the store.

All relationships, primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes are defined in the `answer.sql` file.

## Features

- CRUD operations for **Customers** and **Products**.
- Many-to-Many relationship between **Products** and **Categories**.
